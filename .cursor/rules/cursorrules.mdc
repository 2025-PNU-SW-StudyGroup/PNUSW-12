2. Use open-source vector icon libraries such as Lucide Icons (compatible with ShadCN UI).
3. Use images from free and open-source sources (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels) and link them directly.
4. Build the UI using ShadCN UI components, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- Use ShadCN UI for all base components such as Button, Card, Input, Tabs, etc.
- Customize components using Tailwind utility classes as needed.
5. The UI must be fully responsive using Tailwindâ€™s breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl).
6. Do not include mobile-only UI elements such as status bars or signal indicators.
7. All text must use black or white for clarity and contrast.

## Task Instructions
1, Automatically analyze the image using AI

2. View nutritional breakdown in a clean, card-based layout

3. Act as a Product Manager and define the key functionality and information hierarchy for the first screens, then build them using ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS.

## Deliverables
Create a single HTML or React file (e.g., ui.tsx or ui.html) containing the first two pages of the application:

Page 1: A welcome/landing screen that introduces the app and includes a call-to-action (e.g., "Start Now")

Page 2: A screen where the user can upload or capture a photo of food

The layout must follow a standard vertical scroll structure.

Use ShadCN UI components for all UI elements, styled according to the design principles above.

Ensure responsiveness, consistency, and accessibility.
